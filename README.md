# Portrait-Segmentation using U-Net

**Portrait segmentation** refers to the process of segmenting a person in an image from its background.
Here we use the concept of **semantic segmentation** to predict the label of every pixel in an image. Here we limit ourselves to **binary classes** (person or background) and use only plain **portrait-selfie** images for matting.

This technique is widely used in computer vision applications like **background replacement and background blurring** on mobile devices.
